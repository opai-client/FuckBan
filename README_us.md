# FuckBan
A plugin for displaying online ban status in Opai.

## How to load this plugin

Place the Jar file into:
%APPDATA%\Opai\extensions

Then start your game and open **FuckBan**.  

Once enabled, the current Hypixel ban statistics will be displayed on your Dynamic Island every minute.

## Recommended to use a custom Key
The public Key included in **ChineseMode** has a rate limit.  
(Enabling **ChineseMode** allows you to use the public Key together with a free private proxy forwarder, which helps bypass the issue of not being able to access hypixel.net directly.)
